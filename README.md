# my-screenfetch

my-screen - a CLI Bassh script to system info

based on ScreenFetch script from Brett Bohnenkamper <kittykatt@kittykatt.us>
(I added IP address info & Filesystem info)

support : Ubuntu, Debian & Raspberry (Raspbian) distro

# TODO
- add support to multiple IPv4 interface (only one interface supported right now and no tunnel interface)
- add CPU & RAM load
